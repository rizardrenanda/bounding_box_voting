Unofficial Re-implementation of Bounding Box Voting Algorithm from:
Gidaris, Spyros, and Nikos Komodakis. "Object detection via a multi-region and semantic segmentation-aware cnn model." In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pp. 1134-1142. 2015.

Bounding box voting is used to adjust the initial bounding box coordinate by weighted voting of a set of proposals based on their IoUs.
